However, my most recent led to a pretty big headache. I'm not saying don't shop here, but to learn from my experience so you can avoid the problems I faced. My visit was to add my grandma to my plan. I was told that the phone we were looking for was out of stock everywhere in WNY, so we would have to order it. This was untrue, as it was available at McKinley and two Galleria stores. I opted to order the phone, which I was told would be here in 2 days. The phone will actually get here in 4 days, which is inconvenient because we're flying to Florida to get affairs in order for my grandma to be treated at Roswell here in Buffalo. Third, I was on the T- mobile amplified plan, and somehow taken off of it when the new line was added. So that required a 25 min call to T- Mobile to get re-verified through my employer and get the correct pricing and benefits. I highly recommend checking local inventories, verifying ship times, and letting the rep know about special pricing on your plan during the buying process to make sure everything goes smoothly Rating: 4 Response: None

After spending three years with his prior team. Right from the start my wife and I were immediately impressed. My son fit right in with his new team and his attitude and approach to baseball immediately changed for the better. His coach Joey Tracy handles himself like a true pro and works well with young players. His team was very competitive and played a great fall season. Also the weekly practices are over two hours of hardcore on field training . They have a great approach to managing the growth and success of their players. We couldnâ€™t have been happier with the decision we made to moving him to the Seminoles . Any player looking to play serious competitive baseball in Nassau County should look no further than Batting 1000 Rating: 5 Response: None

__label__neg Business Name: Leonard H. Hecht Category: Attorney, Real estate attorney Description: None Review: Horrible. I'm not sure which of the two I went to speak with because honestly I didn't ask, and they didn't introduce themselves. (My parents have been coming to them before but he had asked to speak to the children of my parents, why? I don't know because he didn't ask us anything and made us waste our time by coming in. Unless he just wanted proof we existed, but really?) He went on to say things about my parents case, and something that he said didn't make sense to us, so the logical thing is to ask. Not with him! He got very agitated just by my question of "what's next" and by my follow up question he kicked me out of the room. He's very unprofessional, what kind of lawyer does not allow you to ask questions and then kick you out for even questioning? How am I supposed to know he's not just taking advantage of my parents because they don't ask questions about things they don't fully understand? Because we have gotten legal letters about our application not being fully submitted or finished, when it was this lawyer's responsibility to be completing and submitting these things. If you don't plan on talking to your lawyer and not asking questions and if you are okay with being confused, then go ahead and see this guy. If you have a brain, go see someone else. Oh and they don't have a bathroom and even though you have an appointment at a certain time, you don't be seen until an hour later or more. Don't eat or drink before coming in.

__label__neg Business Name: Darling Doughnuts Category: Donut shop, Bakery Description: None Review: The base of each donut is the same, a well tasting yeasty dough. The toppings change weekly and sell out quickly. Even showing up at 10am has a limited selection. The toppings are going to be hit or miss depending on your taste buds. All of the ones I got were on the sweeter side. I particularly enjoyed the churro, with a hint of spice in it which really rounded out the flavor. The butter pecan were particularly buttery and smooth. The cinnamon roll was simple in comparison, but still good with chunks of cinnamon sugar on top. The galaxy were a miss for me. According to the menu it has a vanilla ice cream glaze, in practice this gave it a hint of freeze dried ice cream which I didn't find appealing. Rating: 5 Response: None

Review: This coffee chain, based on the west coast, offers the standard hot drink options, along with some light lunch type fare and pastries. I personally found the drink selection to be okay, but they are known for their crushed ice drinks (which means more ice/water, less of the good stuff).

__label__pos Business Name: Binghamton Housing Authority. No Category: Housing authority, Public housing Description: None Review: impossible to reach anyone at the local office here in binghamton. YES we are all aware of the covid situation, but how difficult would it be to help people obtain needed housing during a global health emergency. I would think that HUD would be considered more essential than Burger king or the local pub. FURTHER, i was told that the new CANAL plaza not only has income limits but the limits require that you MAKE a certain amount of money in order to be able to live there. IS THIS not a violation of human rights? I am on disability and my income is less than their requirement of thirteen thousand per year. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? So the bottom line is this, if you are poor you can not live in Canal Plaza. This is a terrible way to treat people. I am college educated but can no longer work due to my disease. SO THEREFORE binghamton has nothing to offer me that would be considered decent housing. I have lived in Binghamton for seven years and have been in a housing crisis for the entire time. BED BUGS forced me out of my first apartment, i lived there for four years. I lost everything. A sewage spill forced me out of my second apartment, it was short term but i was forced to stay (prior to the sewage issue ) because a local landlord posted a listing for an apartment that had false information. When I discovered this, I had already put a deposit on the apartment. WHen i requested the deposit back four days later, I was refused my money. He rented the unit to someone else in the same month that I PAID for. Then the sewage spill rendered me homeless and stuck in a seedy hotel then to the YWCA where I would wake up to people doing drugs in my room with room mate. Intimidation prevented me from resolving the situation there. From there to where I reside now...I had no hot, but just warm water for my first three months here. DURING A PANDEMIC> even though i pay for my own utilities the landlord would not turn it up or allow me to do so. Second hand smoke plagues the building and triggers migraines from the vascular brain disease i have and also asthma. I am stuck here and i just want to thank binghamton for making my stay in their fine city, nothing short of a nightmare. Open up assistance for housing at HUD. its a federal program that is basically doing nothing to help those who desperately need housing. NOT EVEN A WAITING LIST is available...they say its because there are so many people in need. SO OK>>>lets just shut it down then? How does that even make sense at all? Rating: 1 Response: None

They charged me $10 to cancel my membership even though I gave the 45 day notice and I was on a month to month meaning no contract.

Courtesy is scarce and efficiency, well, downright sh*tty; they often leave piles of dropped off packages in the corner of the room outside of the employee area from which anyone could easily pick...if one were so inclined.

__label__neg Business Name: Fury Automotive Category: Auto repair shop, Auto body shop, Car inspection station Description: None Review: A few months a ago after calling an online mechanic to help with my car that cranks but just wonâ€™t start. I asked the mechanic to change my spark plugs as that is what I suspected most. Still no start. He ran a few other diagnostics and confirmed I was getting gas and I had a new battery put in about a month earlier so we crossed that off the list. The mechanic thought it may be the timing chain - and it would require quite a bit of work. Luckily this was not on the normal pricing list so I had time to ask for a second opinion. We saw an ad shopping near Fury, and I had my car towed to Fury. They recommended a towing company and I was the first customer at the shop on that rainy morning. I had no idea what to expect but hoped for the best. After Kent and Alex looked at it, they had the car running in minutes. Something that me and the other mechanic could not do. There was some smoke coming out the tail pipe and I had thought the worst- engine problems. They thought it was bad gas and asked to keep the car for further testing. When I picked up the car, Kent confirmed no engine problems and it was likely just some bad gas. To me they just had that magic touch. Iâ€™m planning on taking my car in for my yearly inspection soon as my first experience was such a relief/ wonderful experience - I donâ€™t think many people can say that about going to an auto shop. I thought a lot of their online reviews were not quite genuine before visiting the shop, but Iâ€™m a believer after my personal experience. Thank you guys!

__label__neg Business Name: 5 Ninth Category: American restaurant, Restaurant Description: Vintage townhouse with a romantic dining room, a patio, New American fare & a cocktail scene. Review: So I had heard that the thing to get here was the roast chicken. And I love a good roast chicken. I love it so much that I was happy to wait the 20 minutes they require for it. No problem. But after the waiting was done, what was presented to me was not roast chicken. It was much more like mostly boneless, pan fried chicken schnitzel. Sort of. It was good though, I liked it, but I wanted roast chicken. More highlights include the bartender lightly rinsing his shaker, making a drink, lightly rinsing it again, and then making mine. Then my drink had in it, remnants of 2 drinks prior (a small piece of mint). The bartender was also not able to transfer a bar tab to the table. Moving on the sides were uninspired and small, the pasta was average, as were the meatballs. The calamari was pretty decent, and the wine list was better than expected. Oh and there was a band playing in the bar that sort of reminded me of John Mayer. But with bongos... Rating: 2 Response: None

__label__neg Business Name: Leisure Tech Category: Swimming pool contractor, Bathroom remodeler, Construction company, Contractor, Kitchen remodeler, Pool cleaning service, Sunroom contractor, Swimming pool repair service, Swimming pool supply store Description: None Review: The team at Leisure Tech is professional, honest and fair. We've used a number of pool companies in the area, but once we met with Mike, Chris and Heather, I knew this was the type of family run business we wanted to work with. They are knowledgeable, attentive, and thorough. If you think pools are easy, you're mistaken. Pools and pool equipment are notoriously finicky and no two pools or filtering systems are identical. The team at Leisure Tech understands this, they know that every pool needs an individualized level of care, problem solving and service. We could not be happier with the way Leisure Tech services our pool, the way they prepare and closed it for the winter and then get it back up and running year after year. Operating a seasonal business cannot be easy. The fact that the same employees have been there year after year tells me everything I need to know. Rating: 5 Response: None

Not only does it take a while for an appt for orientation they tell you it takes about 4 to 5 weeks after you bring in all your documents to get a counselor it took me nearly 4 months before they reached out, not only this but I sent all requested documents to my counselor to see if i be approved that took about 2 and a half months to find out , but the thing is I had to harass her by email to get responses which I barely got. They never answer phones there and to top it off I applied for school after orientation so I would have to wait since they said 4 weeks.. now I'm stuck with first semester student loan because they said I applied way before. To top it off , during this abrupt circumstance that forced everyone to be working from home or online schooling. I have to wait for her to get back in office so she can talk to her manager about me needing a laptop since mine crashed. Never got the help. this place honestly is a joke they seem not to care. They are not friendly and they should've understood what position they took when they wanted to work social work field. I will advocate for myself as well as others and take this higher up. I took it to her supervisor and still nothing. Please do not waste your time going here, I have proof of emails of going back and forth and still never recieved help, they do not help.

Fantastic assortment of tableware, linens, casual throws and casual furniture. Lot of unique decor and design items. And it's all displayed in such a homey inviting way! I really loved just looking at everything. In a way it reminded me of ABC 15-20 years ago when it was fun to shop and do the brunch on Sunday. Combo shopping/dining. This is much much better.

__label__neg Business Name: Big Apple Motorcycle School Category: Motorcycle driving school, Training school Description: None Review: My brother as well as some clients took this course and loved it, so they recommended I sign up. As someone whom is a novice rider this course was worth every penny! Even if you have years experience you should take this course, being aware of your surroundings can save your life and the guides stressed how important it is to look up, scan, and prepare for an escape route which is what I will be always looking out for this summer while riding. Ultimately I feel 1,000x more comfortable about riding and I will be practicing the skills learned in class on my personal bike. Even if I didn't pass the skills portion I would have trusted in their judgement after all getting on a bike has its risks and you should be more than prepared before getting on one. There were a ton of beginner riders in my group I couldn't believe how well they did having never rode a bike before, that's what you get with good coaching! Thanks again Felice and Diane you guys rocked I look forward to coming back for an advanced class. -Amanda C.

__label__neg Business Name: O'Donnell Heating & Air Conditioning Inc Category: HVAC contractor, Air conditioning contractor, Air conditioning repair service, Furnace repair service, Heating contractor, Mechanical contractor Description: None Review: My wife and I have worked with Jim O'Donnell and his crew for many years, first to have a boiler installed to replace our ancient one, and more recently to have two Lennox "mini-split" air conditioners installed downstairs, adding them to the one we have in our master bedroom. When we contacted O'Donnell, my wife spoke with Dawn, his secretary, about setting up a time for Jim to come to our home to assess our needs. He arrived on time and spoke with us about different options for cooling the downstairs. We decided upon the two mini-splits mentioned above and arranged to have them installed in just a few days. Two of Jim's workers -- Tim and Nick -- arrived promptly on the day we had arranged for the installation, and everything went flawlessly. After the mini-splits were put in place they were tested and everything worked as designed. (The air conditioning units themselves are outdoors, small, and reasonably discreet.) The mini-splits now on our walls are whisper quiet, and during these days of heat and high humidity work quickly and efficiently to cool our home. In fact, one of them is on as I write this. We are very pleased with the units and with O'Donnell Heating and Cooling. Rating: 5 Response: None

However, Father's topics are too far a field and for the most part, don't seem to make any impression, at least they don't on me. Tell him to watch the portion of the movie "Doubt" where the priest gives a sermon on GOSSIP. Now, that's they type of sermon that the congregation can relate to. Rating: 2 Response: None

Everyone was talking to me at once trying to get my business but I connected with Kristen. She was attentively waiting on me. She's a good listener, very calm and have tons of integrity. She sold me exactly what I needed and explained everything to me. She took her time and when everything was completed, I left leaving refreshed and happy. Thank you Kristen. 3 months later after buying the phone for $200 I changed my experience with Tmobile was horrible. I was sold a 32 gig when I told them I needed more gigs due to my career. 2 months with issues calling customer service back and forth not to mention going back to the store to complain. No solution to phone full to capacity. I purchased card and everything. Everything I went back to the store they tried be to make me buy a new phone. Finally I couldn't take it anymore I moved over to Metro pcs the back to my original plan. At lease the customer service listen. I felt like I was in bondage with Tmobile.

Review: This place used to be Pok Pok Wings. It is now Pok Pok Phat Thai, since Sept 2012. It'll probably be something else as they rotate through the Pok Pok menu. Tiny space, seats 10-15 on bar stools and the physical size of the kitchen limits the menu. I'd love to live in the 'hood just to experience all the variety. Pad Thai, 5 versions, optionally wrapped in a thin omlette. Plus a special and another dish with the wide noddles, everything cooked to perfection with a myriad of little tastes.

__label__neg Business Name: Cafe Category: Cafe Description: None Review: Don't understand why people place comments about a business that has nothing to do with the hospital. Sure prices may be on the higher end but tell me this, what other options do you have? Even if you do venture out to find another place, you may find pricing lower but it's still fast food choices. Do you really think you're going to get some fancy takeout at this or any other location that serves up fast food? If you want a better meal, then make sure you have a car to drive outside this neighborhood. One comment reads, add more seasoning. Not everyone salt intake the same. If you want more, then add it yourself. They need to cater to the general population and not just yours. Another comment, food is nasty. It's fast food, you want better then go outside and purchase your own fast food you like. My main point here is, stop the drama/complaining, eat your food and don't talk with your mouth full. See now, that's nasty. I give this establishment a 3 1/2 star rating. It works for what you need it for and that's a quick meal to eat. It caters more to customers who don't want to venture out for a meal. Rating: 4 Response: None

Then I bring it elsewhere and I'm told the issues will cost around $1000 to fix because it is no longer under warranty. Browns jerked me around until I was just past warranty then said "I don't know whats wrong with it, try bringing it to a chevy dealer." If they can't service chevy vehicles correctly perhaps they should take down their "We service all makes and models" sign. As the previous reviewer noted they certainly take their time doing everything, I've had my car sit there all day from 8 am until 5 pm for an oil change. I certainly will not be purchasing another vehicle from this poorly run establishment and most likely will not be bringing my car back to their service center. Rating: 1 Response: None

I didn't think much of the corned beef but I should know better than to order it when not at a real deli that makes it right. I will go again though.

Review: This is my 2nd time going to Big Apple Mobility. The first time was in 2013 when I purchased my first Pride Victory 10 mobility scooter. I went back on 11/18/2018 when my poor scooter was on its last wheels. The management was different and the location moved down the block. I met Jonathan and he was extremely helpful. He helped figure out what was the likely cause of my chair's issues ad gave me options. He even told me what chair would be best even if it meant not making a bigger profit. I ultimately bought a new Pride Victory 10 and Jonathan was great. He even said he would discard my old scooter. I would definitely shop there again as long as Jonathan still works there.

Review: Very special sushi take out! Their warm food is also wonderful and is prepared so quickly, so it is the perfect lunch spot. Everything is so fresh, unique, and incredibly tasty. The only thing holding me back from going every day is the price. The rolls are around $6 a box and the hot food is around $10 a dish. The salads are small and $9 which is a bit ridiculous, but seriously worth the money, so I get it. Their vegetarian options are stellar. Smoked tofu rolls and multiple different kinds of salads are a huge draw. They have a spicy seaweed salad and a quinoa and onion salad that are both to die for. I wish I could have them every day for lunch! The staff is also incredibly friendly and the environment is incredibly gracious and warm. Rating: 4 Response: None

While we have driven past it countless numbers of times, we had never stopped, though we had talked about it often. Luigi's sits back a bit off of Route 299, on the left hand side, not far at all from 9W, only 2 or three minutes, going toward New Paltz. While looks can be very deceiving from the road, this is an absolute must from the true lovers of, Authentic Old World Italian Specialties. For those familiar with the famous " Arthur Ave " in the Bronx......its here. We met Maria, who prepared one of the best Mixed Italian Specialtie Sub I've ever had, let Maria make it her way, with fresh pesto, the roasted peppers, and only thier authentic imported Italian cold cuts, and she'll top it off with fresh Arugula, on real Italian Bread. My wife had an Italian Wedding Soup that was amazing, and we took a few slices of thier homemade pizza to go for later.They also have homemade gourmet olive oils to sample that are amazing, fresh pasta and various homemade sauces, along with pickled Eggplant, and much more. The topper are the homemade mini pastries that Maria makes fresh daily, which we took a dozen. Totally worth the little ride, and now with having to do curbside, it's a great time to go visit and have a look at an Old World Italian Deli......by the way, Italian breakfast sandwiches are served all day long. Tell Maria, Scott sent you....Monge ! Rating: 5 Response: None

__label__neg Business Name: Cohen's Fashion Optical Category: Contact lenses supplier, Eye care center, Optician Description: None Review: I walked into the store and a gentleman saw me walk in. A minute or so later he asks if I had been helped? Why ask if you see me walk in ... and then a young woman took my order, to replace the progressive lenses in existing frames with my new prescription. I opted for platic over polycarbonate. She quoted me a price, but when she went to write up the final receipt she told me I 'had' to go with the Polycarbonate due to my prescription, that there would be additional cost to plastic so I should just pay up for better product. At that point I said you quoted me a specific price, give me back my glasses and I will go somewhere else. Then she backed off and said she would honor the original quote. I paid a deposit and left. She never introduced herself and now looking at the receipt, all i see is my deposit, nothing else. Bottom line, I sure hope I am not sorry I went there when I pick up my glasses.

__label__neg Business Name: Sleightsburg Park ramp Category: Boat ramp Description: None Review: Boat Ramp Review: Good launch with some minor issues. Access road has a transition from paved to gravel at the end that bottoms out my hitch set at 14" above the ground...slight scrape so I just go slowly. Gravel access road develops deep holes that are occasionally filled. My tandem axle trailer handles them ok...slowly. Access road is single lane so if another full size pickup is coming the other way, somebody has to back up. Ramp is wide, slightly steep and textured for traction. My 24 foot trailer will fall of the end of the cement at loweat tide in order to launch or retrieve deep V keeled boat. I avoid that scenario. Parking: weekend days the parking will fill up around 11 A.M. in the summer. If boaters with trailers park close together the lot rarely fills. Most days there will be several cars occupying trailer spaces. There is plenty of parking for rooftoppers in areas that will not fit a trailer. Many times the lot is full due to unnecessarily wide spacing. Lot full by 7A.M. on weekends during striper season. Park has nice flat trails for walking. Dogs enjoy a dip in the estuary and river/creek views are good. Poison ivy abounds in the forested areas. I reccomend the ramp and parklands, just please park close to the next vehicle and we will all agree to exercise good door discipline. See you out there. Rating: 5 Response: None

It was my first implant and Dr. has seen my stress and knew exactly how to deal with it. I had local anesthesia and the whole procedure was very, very quick and painless! Came back around 7 weeks later for an implant and again my experience was simply amazing. No pain, pure professionalism and wonderful care. Dental assistants are also great, respectful and informative. Front desk was good too. Lastly their financial department is great at taking care of your business - although they don't take my insurance, they send the claim to them for possible reimbursement.

The problem is that lack of communication on anything. I got told several times that I could be called when the suit came in, and then again when the alterations were done and the suit could be picked up. NEVER got a phone call, NOR did my best friend who paid for the suits. Honestly, I donâ€™t have the time to be calling all the time to figure out if my suit is ready, and if the right staff member will be there to take care of what I need. More than likely, will never buy a suit form this store personally. Rating: 2 Response: None

First I pulled up and the workers turned the equipment hook up location into his own personal mechanic spot for his BMW. I guess they work on their personal cars on their down time. I have pictures to prove it. So to make a long story short. I needed to rent a truck at the last minute. Get there and Jason states that they donâ€™t take cash deposits because people steal uhaul trucks. I guess he was trying to make the situation better. Lol!!! So he calls his general manager Russell singer which I asked to speak to and he refused to come to the phone. Big red flag. But said that I can use a friend or family credit card over the phone. Even more crazy. Looks like this location has there own rules. Called corporate office they said uhaul takes cash deposits. This location does what it wants. Run Run as fast as you can.

At first I was dreading the class because I accidentally booked it at an out of the way location, but my experience changed it all. I arrived 15 minutes early for my class. I was quickly checked in, changed my shoes, and headed into the class. A staff member helped me adjust my seat, explained the resistance knob on the bike, and pointed out the weights on the side of the bike that would be used in class. The instructor was Sam Lee and he was great! He began by telling us about the different positions on the bike and also explained the resistance knob. When I went to a class at the Bryant Park location, none of this was ever explained and made it so difficult for a first timer like me to follow. I'm glad that Sam took the time to do this. Sam was super energetic and pushed the class. It was a great workout. The locker room is also quite spacious. There are about 6 showers and a nice amount of bathroom area to freshen up.

__label__neg Business Name: Pok Pok Phat Thai Category: Thai restaurant Description: Noodle-oriented Thai food is served in this tiny, no-frills outpost of the notable Portland eatery. Review: The good here definitely outweighs the bad. Or another way to think about it is that the "bad" isn't actually bad. It's not quite "bad' in the 80's slang (think "not bad meaning bad but bad meaning good" to quot Rev. Run) but bad in that it doesn't really matter. See, I was concerned that $12.50 buys a mere six wings. In our fair city, it's not difficult to find establishments that have wing specials that will net you a wing for about a quarter. Sometimes less. But I'd take the Pepsi challenge when it comes to those other wings, because these ones are good! Really good. Though I will make one complaint, I ordered the wings spicy, and they were about as spicy as most places make their medium. I'm guessing that due to other people complaining about the heat of the food, they've toned it down across the board. This is partially Pok Pok's fault, because they should make the mild really mild. But it's also customers' fault, because get tough yo!!! And if you're really concern, they pair well with Six Point Sweet Action, which will mute the spice. My last concern was that six wings wouldn't be enough, but the wing they serve is the full wing, aka they don't snip the tip. Plus it's connected to some breast meat that makes the six seem more like a dozen plus. Awesome! And last note, the water in the cooler tastes weird. I guess this is on purpose, since they put some rice-like herb in it, but ew. Rating: 4 Response: None

__label__neg Business Name: Cerulean Clouds LLC Category: Vaporizer store, Lounge Description: None Review: This place didn't seem like a store; more like a friend of a friend's place who happens to have some vaping odds and ends. I was visiting from out of the area and was able to get a coil that I needed (not my preferred coil, but it worked) One coil costs about double what I pay a little farther south in NY! The selection of vape juice is really pathetic- maybe 5 to 10 brands. Unless you are desperate, skip this shop.

As we are not a large chain we do not have the resources to be overly competitive with our prices as well as we keep the stock we can. We are currently as you said pretty friend to friend. We help out our local customers by getting whatever they may need, however we do struggle with customers who are just stopping by once. We will take your comment into consideration and try harder to expand our brand selection. Thank you for your time and have a wonderful night!'}

We just had a 3rd baby and totaled one of our cars that's why I had driven up there to buy a car from someone and now I had to fix things on it I was really bummed, everyone knows budgeting is huge when you have kids! We were in a pickle. He insisted on redoing the whole brake system, but he agreed to do so at a really reasonable price. So thankful to this family shop, they seem like really nice people and the work looks legit. I recommend.

After all, it was called CitiRib! My lady and I sat at the bar and shared a full rack of ribs (cheaper than two half racks) and they were wonderful. She had a drink - mudslide, which she said was very good. I ordered Margueritas - on the rocks with salt. What i received was marguerita in a stemmed glass with a straw. I order the salt because I like it, and you cant taste the salt using a straw. I asked if it could be put in a different glass and was offered a "rocks" glass! I said that will do, but put the salt on the glass. This worked (kinda) as they used a very fine table salt, where a coarser salt is called for. Marguerita tasted great, and did i say the ribs were wonderful? They were. A definite revisit and recommendation. Rating: 4 Response: None

They were going to "squeeze" her into their schedule. The technician was rushing my mother to walk to the open MRI location. (She walks slowly with a cane.) She was very impatient. She wanted to know why my mother needed an MRI. I explained to her and showed her the original MRI script (the doctor faxed them an updated one that DID NOT include "with contrast". This technician wrote that' I refused" the contrast which I did not. The doctor's orders indicated NO CONTRAST. Yet the technician was adamant that she should complete the MRI WITH CONTRAST.

He worked quickly and I had a new key in no time. The best part, he didn't take advantage by overcharging me for his service. He also made a key remote which was equally inexpensive. Thank you Al.

__label__neg Business Name: Sheltering Arms Category: Non-profit organization Description: None Review: The staff caused me to catch an ACS case that ended up costing my wife her job. Outside the realm of reason, they insisted that my niece was being abused by me even though I had the child in my care for less than a week. My niece has violent siblings and a mother with mental challenges. The staff at both sheltering arms were aware that the children weren't being cared for properly. But they never called ACS to intervene on behalf of the mother. However, once the children were taken from their home and placed with my family, they had scars across their bodies, all 3 children were suffering from pneumonia, and their hygiene was subpar. Both Sheltering Arms locations exclaimed upon seeing the children after one weekend with my family how different the children looked. They were clean, had new clothes, and had an entirely different demeanor. However, the Sheltering Arms staff on Bergen Avenue decided that these factors were irrelevant because the youngest child had a small bruise on her face. They were informed that the bruise was due to an older sibling striking the child. But due to me being a man, they refused to accept this premise even while admitting that the child had shown up with sibling wounds previously and that it was a normal occurrence. However, since I am not the child's parent, I must have done the violence. Even though no abusive person would deliver a child to a school with visible wounds. That's stupidity at its finest. But I wrote all this out to simply warn parents that this school is staffed by racist, sexist individuals. I am a Black man and the school is predominantly staffed and patronized by Hispanic women. These women did not feel they needed to abide by the mandated reporter edict when the children showed up for years with scars and poor hygiene. However, they absolutely demanded that ACS prosecute me for abuse and neglect after having the children for a weekend. The children are now in foster care and have been for the better part of a year. And my family has been decimated by the ACS investigation that is also extremely flawed. My wife, who was not even home when the incident occurred was placed on the State Registry for child abuse and lost not only her current job but also lost her new job that was going to pay $50k/yr. That would have been life changing for my family. I have two children of my own. Far older than the nieces who fostered with us for a single weekend. Never had any semblance of a case concerning them. The Sheltering Arms staff at Bergen Avenue watched these girls be neglected for years and did nothing. But the moment they saw a man, they decided that I and my family by extension should be the scapegoats for these girls terrible circumstances. The new clothes didnt matter, the vastly improved hygiene didnt matter, the improved disposition didnt matter. All that mattered was I was Black and a man. Therefore, I must have struck a two year old baby in the face hard enough to bruise. If you are Hispanic, these are your people and I'm sure they will look out for you. However, if you are Black. I would caution you to look elsewhere for childcare. The staff are selective in who they choose to protect and when. So, it's best you look for a more reputable business to care for your children.

All the nails looked horrible and didn't replicate the picture, not even close. Coffin nails didn't even look coffin. He told me one price and I agreed to it. He then adds $10 extra to the bill. Asked him why, he can't give me a straight answer. Made a scene because he expected me to give up $60 for ombre that looked like a 4-year old did it. Again guys don't waste your time coming here.

__label__neg Business Name: Ithaca Family Chiropractic Category: Chiropractor Description: None Review: Arguments about the effectiveness and science of chiropractic aside, I've suffered from chronic neck, back, and shoulder pain for 20 years, and regular chiropractic adjustments is one of the few things I've found that makes a big difference in keeping the pain at bay. Most, if not all, of the previous chiropractor offices I've visited pretty much resembled doctors' offices, including the stuffy and uncomfortable waiting rooms. Dr. Brian's practice is completely different; it has the look and feel of an open, sunny, airy physical therapy gym. It's a friendly, energetic, and healthy-feeling atmosphere. I am always impressed by the positive enthusiasm of Dr. Brian and his staff. Everyone is welcoming, smiling, and they are always flexible and understanding if we ever need to change our appointment time. As far as his chiropractic skills are concerned, he is the best chiropractor I've ever visited. He listens and takes his time with all members of our family, and he will always take a moment to answer nutrition and exercise questions when I've got them. If you are looking for a chiropractor in the Ithaca region, I must recommend Ithaca Family Chiropractic wholeheartedly.
